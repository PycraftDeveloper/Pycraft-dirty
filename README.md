# Pycraft-dirty
This public repository will be used for pre-dev release versions of Pycraft as a way of backing up code before significant changes, and as a place to explore different variants of code before we consolidate to a final solution.

PYCRAFT RELEASES SHARED HERE ARE NOT COMPLETE, EVEN FROM A DEVELOPER PERSPECTIVE AND WILL CONTAIN BUGS, DO NOT EXPECT CODE HERE TO BE MAINTAINED OR GUIDES FOR USAGE SUPPLIED OUTSIDE OF THE USUAL FOR PYCRAFT. SOME DEVELOPMENT SKILLS WILL BE REQUIED IN ORDER TO USE OR TRY OUT ALTERNATIVE ENGINES.
